      <h1>What is MemeFryer?</h1>
      <p>Memes are a big part of modern life, most people in the world have seen a meme at some point. Deep fried memes are a sub-genre of memes. They all involve increasing the gamma, contrast, saturation, & many other image properties.</p>
      <p>Making deep fried memes is not always as easy as it may seem though. You either end up using a free service that leaves a watermark, or end up paying for a software that is easy to get lost in from all the bells & whistles you don't want or need.</p>
      <p>MemeFryer is here to help everyone make deep fried memes with a simple interface, with only the effects you want to use. No fluffy nonsense here!</p>
      <p>The goal is to be able to make memes like these ⬇️⬇️⬇️</p>
