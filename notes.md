# 1/12/24 -- GitHub Assignment -- I think I learned the difference between all the different 'git (insert word here)' things

* git add: adds changes to a list that is local
* git commit -m '(whatever text here)': applies the changes to both the local version of the repository
* git push: applies the changes to the online GitHub version of the repository as well
* I learned that using VS Code's "Source Control" is much easier than doing everything in the terminal with GitBash
* I did get help from my CS roommate, the internet, & from ChatGPT


# 1/22/24 -- Startup Assignment
* I changed my project idea. It was going to be a video editor, but now it's just a deep fried image maker
* I don't know how to write the code for all the different technologies, but I'll learn at some point


# 1/29/24 -- AWS-EC2
* idk what I did wrong but I followed all the steps to set it up. The server's status is "running" but I can't connect in my browser (I tried both Brave & Microsoft Edge bc those are the only 2 I have. I want to get rid of Edge though). I even rebooted the server, but it's still not working
* turns out in the instructions it said to make **Inbound & Outbound Rules** but it didn't show a picture of where to click for that, so I assumed it would do it itself. I messaged the discord to ge help & I fixed it. I also thought in the instructions in the **SSH into your server**, that it meant to use the console in the AWS website, but that didn't work so I used it in VSCode & it worked fine.
* the ip for the website is http://54.158.188.159//
* command I used in VSCode terminal to SSH into it "ssh -i CS260.pem ubuntu@54.158.188.159"


# 1/30/24 -- HTTPS, TLS, and certificates
* This may sound dumb, but I literally just learned that the Github schedule for this class is WAYY better than the Canvas schedule. I completely missed the steps to buy a domain name with the Route53 stuff. But now I know to ALWAYS look at the Github schedule.
* I learned that when I'm editing the Caddy file, that using "vi Caddyfile" is really hard. Apparently if you use "nano Caddyfile" it's a LOT more user friendly, while still being able to edit the file.
* When I buy a domain, it's better to use a ".click" rather than a ".com" or ".org" because they are always cheaper
* I also did "the console" assignment. I'm pretty sure I understood what was going on. I made a txt file called 'test', & put a print thing in it. Then copied that file & made a new file from it called 'other'. put the contents of the 'test' file in the 'other' file, then deleted the 'test' file. then did a function that ran through the 'other' file to get an output. I'm wayy more used to Python, but it made sense coneceptually
