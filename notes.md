* git add: adds changes to a list that is local
* git commit -m '(whatever text here)': applies the changes to both the local version of the repository
* git push: applies the changes to the online GitHub version of the repository as well
* I learned that using VS Code's "Source Control" is much easier than doing everything in the terminal with GitBash
* I did get help from my CS roommate, the internet, & from ChatGPT
